feat(scraper): refactor LUSE price scraping to provider model

This commit refactors the LUSE price scraping functionality to align with the existing provider-based architecture. The previous implementation, which relied on a standalone script, has been replaced with a more modular and maintainable approach.

Key changes:

- **New `LUSEProvider`**: A `LUSEProvider` class has been created to encapsulate the logic for scraping data from the LUSE website. This promotes code reuse and separation of concerns.
- **`MarketScraper` Integration**: The `MarketScraper` has been updated to recognize and use the new `LUSEProvider`, ensuring a consistent data fetching process across all providers.
- **Configuration Update**: The `docker-compose.yml` file has been modified to use the `luse` provider by default and enable the scraper service.
- **Removed Obsolete Script**: The legacy `update_luse_prices.py` script has been deleted to eliminate redundancy and potential conflicts.

This refactoring improves the overall quality of the codebase by making it more scalable, maintainable, and easier to extend with new data providers in the future.
